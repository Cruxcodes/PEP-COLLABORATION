          Governor Willie Obiano has built, not just a stadium in Awka, but a
          FIFA-standard stadium, located in the heart of the city, meaning that
          international tournaments would, henceforth, be hosted in Awka. Few
          months ago, this glittering stadium within state of the art modern
          facilities, was a piece of abandoned land where daring herders grazed
          their cattle. It is designed as a compact sporting facility with a
          covered stand, swanky dressing rooms, an electronic scoreboard,
          FIFA-standard pitch and Olympic-standard tartan tracks for sprinters.
          The facility can accommodate future expansion possibilities and still
          retain a large parking space.
