          Anambra East Local Council. His parents, Philip and Christiana, are

          Following Nigeria’s military coup in 1966, many Igbo families lost
          their loved ones in the pogrom in Northern Nigeria. Amid the
          uncertainties, the July counter-coup occurred, and 11-year-old
          Willie and his siblings returned to their classrooms, with ill omen
          muffling family conversations in homes. In May 1967, Lt.-Col. Emeka
          Ojukwu, as Military Governor of Eastern Region, declared the region
          the Independent State of Biafra. The declaration changed the history
          of the region and the country.
