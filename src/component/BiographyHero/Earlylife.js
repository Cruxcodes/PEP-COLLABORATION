            Following Nigeriaâ€™s military coup in 1966, many Igbo families lost
            their loved ones in the pogrom in Northern Nigeria. Amid the
            uncertainties, the July counter-coup occurred, and 11-year-old
            Willie and his siblings returned to their classrooms, with ill omen
            muffling family conversations in homes. In May 1967, Lt.-Col. Emeka
            Ojukwu, as Military Governor of Eastern Region, declared the region
            the Independent State of Biafra. The declaration changed the history
            of the region and the country.
